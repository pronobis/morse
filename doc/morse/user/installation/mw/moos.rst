MOOS
~~~~

To build the MOOS middleware, you need to install MOOS and ``pymoos`` (MOOS Python bindings) on your system.

The instructions below install the new MOOS V10 release.  Information on
installing previous versions of MOOS and ``pymoos`` can be found on their respective
homepages: `MOOS homepage
<http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mobile/MOOS/wiki/pmwiki.php>`_ and `pymoos homepage
<http://pymooos.sourceforge.net/>`_.

The ``pymoos`` bindings require at a minimum that the core MOOS packages be
installed.  ``pymoos`` is curently written for the pre-V10 header structure and so
MOOS must be compiled with the ``ENABLE_V10_COMPATIBILITY`` flag set. To install the
core MOOS components to your home directory::

    $ cd ~/
    $ git clone https://github.com/themoos/core-moos.git
    $ cd core-moos
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../ -DENABLE_V10_COMPATIBILITY=ON
    $ make
    
``pymoos`` also requires the Boost Python library compiled for Python 3.  The Boost versions shipped with newer versions of Ubuntu include both 2.7 and 3.2 versions of the Boost Python library and CMake will select the appropriate version.  

For older versions of Ubuntu (or other OS's), the latest version of the Boost source code can be downloaded from `Boost <http://http://www.boost.org>`_.  To install, extract the contents of the archive and run::

    $ ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=path/to/installation/prefix --with-python-version=3.2
    $ ./b2 install

Finally ``pymoos`` can be installed by::

    $ git clone git@github.com:davidhodo/pymoos.git
    $ cd pymoos
    $ mkdir build
    $ cmake ../
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The installation can be verified by running ``import pymoos.MOOSCommClient``
from a Python3 interpreter.
